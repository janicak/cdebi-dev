Of course IODP provides the lion's share of the resources required to access the deep subseafloor, from deep-sea drilling platforms to installations of CORK observatories. IODP also provides a wealth of other opportunities for researchers, students and educators, including access to and development of other physical assets, networking with existing and new colleagues world-wide, professional scientific and leadership development and involvement in IODP's outstanding educational outreach programs. Initially, the IODP can appear to be an intimidating and unfathomable organization. However, with a few helpful hints and the encouragement of your friends, you should soon find yourself in the middle of a treasure-trove of valuable resources and opportunities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-started\"><a class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\" href=\"#getting-started\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a> Getting Started</h2>\n<p>For starters, check out the <a href=\"http://www.iodp.org/\">IODP webpage</a>.
