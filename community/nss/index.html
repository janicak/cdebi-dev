<p>C-DEBI <em><strong>seeks nominations</strong></em> for three speakers for the 2015-2016 program year. Potential speakers can be nominated by colleagues, mentors, or those mentored by C-DEBI participants; they may also self nominate. Selected <em>C-DEBI Networked Speakers</em> will make a presentation online, using video conferencing tools, with assistance from the C-DEBI main office at USC. Presentations are to be about 30 minutes in length, with time allocated for questions and discussion. Networked viewers can participate in Q&amp;A via their own web camera and speaker/microphone or by chat. We would like to have two presentations during the 2015-2016 academic year, ideally one in the winter and one in the spring. No travel will be required either to make a presentation or to listen/participate in a presentation. Presentations will be recorded for later online playback by participants or those who could not &quot;attend&quot; the live web event. Nominated <em>C-DEBI Networked Speakers</em> should be capable of combining compelling visual materials with the ability to communicate effectively to a broad audience. <em>We are particularly enthusiastic about giving young researchers a chance to present work to the C-DEBI community</em>. Being selected to be a <em>C-DEBI Networked Speaker</em> is an honor. Once speakers are selected, presentation dates and times for presentations will be determined and announced, along with instructions for connecting over the web.

We would like to have two presentations during the 2015-2016 academic year, ideally one in the winter and one in the spring. No travel will be required either to make a presentation or to listen/participate in a presentation. Presentations will be recorded for later online playback by participants or those who could not \"attend\" the live web event. Nominated _C-DEBI Networked Speakers_ should be capable of combining compelling visual materials with the ability to communicate effectively to a broad audience. _We are particularly enthusiastic about giving young researchers a chance to present work to the C-DEBI community_.
