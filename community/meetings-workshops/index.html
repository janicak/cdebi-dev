<p><em>Sanctuary Beach Resort, Marina, California, USA</em></p>
<p>The focus of this Annual Meeting was integration and collaboration.  At that time, we knew that we had been renewed and discussed future plans as well as reported on active C-DEBI research projects. The purpose of the meeting was to continue to give community members from different field sites and/or with different interests a significant opportunity to make new connections that will help us to collectively solve especially interesting problems in study of subsurface life. Consequently, a relatively large fraction of the meeting was set aside for (i) many very brief presentations and (ii) open-mic discussions.</p>
<p>This annual meeting was preceded by a C-DEBI/MARINE Graduate Student and Postdoctoral Professional Development Workshop on October 4, 2015 co-hosted by MARINE (Monterey Area Research Institutions' Network for Education). This day-long workshop &quot;Making the Transition from Graduate Studies to the Interdisciplinary Workforce&quot; aimed to better prepare the participants as future science leaders.</p>

<p>The focus of C-DEBI’s second Annual Meeting (formerly titled the &quot;All Hands Meeting&quot;) was on potential future directions for the STC so that we can engage new communities and achieve high priority goals. To this end, we discussed progress made on selected projects, learned about frontiers in deep biosphere research (including some not involving subseafloor realms), and explored future options for new Major Programs (where C-DEBI may focus attention and resources over the next several years). The meeting included plenary presentations aimed at a broad audience, poster sessions featuring results of individual studies, breakout groups to examine progress and needs of C-DEBI research themes, mentoring activities for junior scientists and graduate students, and time to socialize and discuss recent STC activities and goals for the future.</p>

<p>The initial invitation for the workshop summarized the desired outcomes: as the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations (C-DEBI) enters the final stage of Phase I, we are organizing a workshop to synthesize what we have learned about the microbial ecology of subseafloor basement environments, including igneous rocks and crustal fluids. Topics of discussion will include where the bleeding edge of subseafloor crustal microbiology lies, the biggest current obstacles to overcome, commonalities between sites and regimes that have come to light over the last five years (or more), and what questions will be most exciting to address in the coming decade. We are looking for input from microbial ecologists as well as geochemists and petrologists to help synthesize the current research and try to invigorate the community with interdisciplinary goals for the next phase of C-DEBI. Unlike previous C-DEBI workshops, this one will not focus on a specific theme, such as activity or diversity, but will rather look at the entirety of crustal microbiology. We hope you can join us in Boston this July for a few days of stimulating and productive discussions.</p>

<p>The 2015 C-DEBI Sediment Workshop was held at the University of Southern California, June 25-26. There were 16 in-person attendees and 2 people participating remotely. During the first part of the first day, each participant gave a short presentation on a research project or interest relevant to the subseafloor sedimentary biosphere. For the remainder of the first day and the second day, the participants engaged in group discussion of the following three questions about the deep subseafloor sedimentary biosphere: 1. What is known? 2. What are the major questions? 3. How can we go about answering these questions?</p>

<p>In the initial phase of C-DEBI, the following four themes were the focus of C-DEBI research, providing a conceptual framework for scientific investigation supported by C-DEBI across a broad scientific community: <em>Activity</em>, <em>Extent of Life</em>, <em>Limits to Life</em>, and <em>Evolution and Survival</em>. For each of these themes, Theme Team Leaders regularly brought together experts within and outside of C-DEBI to identify new research directions within each theme. Based on these “think tank” conversations, the Theme Team Leaders developed Requests for Proposals for the initial phase of C-DEBI small grants and fellowship programs.</p>

<p><em>Theme Team Leaders:</em> Wiebke Ziebis (USC, 2010) &amp; Beth Orcutt (Bigelow, 2012-2014)</p>
<p>What is the global consequence of microbial activity in the marine deep sediment and crustal biospheres? How quickly, or slowly, do processes occur, and what factors regulate these rates? What types of microbial processes are dominant in different environments, and why? What are cell specific rates of activity in the marine deep biosphere? Through targeted support of research aiming to quantify geographic distributions of subseafloor sedimentary respiration, rates and magnitude of microbial crustal alteration, energy sources and carbon flow, C-DEBI enables robust analyses linking subseafloor processes to global scales and biogeochemical cycles.</p>

<p>Over time, the interplay of microbial dispersal and environmental selection creates a distinct biogeography of microbes in the subseafloor. What microbes take seed where and why? What are the most significant physical and chemical controls of these colonization processes? How similar or different are the resulting microbial ecosystems in the ocean crust and in deep sediment from each other and from the overlying deep ocean? By studying multiple sites and subseafloor habitats, C-DEBI research aims to develop a global model for biogeography of microbes below the seafloor.</p>

<p><em>Theme Team Leader:</em> Tom McCollom (UC Boulder, 2010-2014)</p>
<p>Numerous studies by C-DEBI participants and others continue to show that microbial life is widespread in the subseafloor. At the same time, however, life is not everywhere, and where it does occur it appears to operate at very slow metabolic rates. How do environmental variables such as temperature, pressure, nutrient availability, fluid flow, pore space, etc. limit the distribution and metabolism of microorganisms in the deep subsurface? What defines the boundary where life can no longer exist in the deep subsurface? C-DEBI promotes investigations into the factors that limit the extent and activity of life in the deep subseafloor, including field, laboratory, and theoretical studies.</p>

<p><em>Theme Team Leaders:</em> Bill Nelson (USC, 2010-2013) &amp; Julie Huber (2013-2014)</p>
<p>Reproduction, change, and selection are necessary elements of any evolutionary trajectory, but we know very little about evolution and adaptation in subseafloor habitats. What are the metabolic drivers that might lead to selection in the subseafloor? In an environment where biomass turnover may occur on a timescale of hundreds to thousands of years, can you actually detect evolutionary changes? How does lateral gene transfer impact evolutionary trajectories in the subseafloor? Through a combination of field and laboratory based measurements, C-DEBI research aims to examine these key questions about microbial evolutionary processes in the subseafloor.</p>

<p>With the DEBI RCN, we held annual, theme-based meetings to address the research and coordination efforts of the growing deep biosphere community. These meetings enabled scientists and students to exchange ideas in deep biosphere studies, to learn about practical developments and study opportunities in the field, and to coordinate research and education activities. Each meeting was part <strong>scientific conference</strong> and part <strong>training workshop</strong>, both parts focused on a specific theme within deep biosphere research. These key themes included microbiology in sediments and basement rock, organic geochemistry and biosignatures, bioenergetics, hydrogeology, and drilling and sampling technology.</p>

Topics of discussion will include where the bleeding edge of subseafloor crustal microbiology lies, the biggest current obstacles to overcome, commonalities between sites and regimes that have come to light over the last five years (or more), and what questions will be most exciting to address in the coming decade. We are looking for input from microbial ecologists as well as geochemists and petrologists to help synthesize the current research and try to invigorate the community with interdisciplinary goals for the next phase of C-DEBI. Unlike previous C-DEBI workshops, this one will not focus on a specific theme, such as activity or diversity, but will rather look at the entirety of crustal microbiology.

To this end, we discussed progress made on selected projects, learned about frontiers in deep biosphere research (including some not involving subseafloor realms), and explored future options for new Major Programs (where C-DEBI may focus attention and resources over the next several years). The meeting included plenary presentations aimed at a broad audience, poster sessions featuring results of individual studies, breakout groups to examine progress and needs of C-DEBI research themes, mentoring activities for junior scientists and graduate students, and time to socialize and discuss recent STC activities and goals for the future.\n\n**Day 1**: C-DEBI, Juan de Fuca, South Pacific Gyre and North Pond Overview • Invited Plenary (Joe Vallino) • Invited Plenary (Rick Colwell) • Research Themes • Invited Plenary (John Priscu) • Research Theme Breakout 1 • Research Theme Breakout 2• Proposed Major Programs Poster Session\n\n**Day 2**: Invited Plenary (Matthew Schrenk) • Proposed Major Programs Overview • Proposed Major Programs Breakout 1 • Education and Outreach • Invited Plenary (Edward Peltzer) • Graduate Student and Postdoctoral Poster Session • Invited Plenary (Wolfgang Bach) • Proposed Major Programs Breakout 2 • Major Programs Wrap Up & The Next Two Years\n\n::: also\nDownload the [final agenda (PDF)](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2012AHM_Agenda.pdf)\n:::\n\n### C-DEBI Annual Meeting, May 16-17, 2011\n\n_University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA_\n\nThe focus of C-DEBI’s first Annual Meeting (formerly titled the \"All Hands Meeting\") was to discuss, report and plan past, present and future research and activities of our Center to build our knowledge of life in the subseafloor biosphere.\n\n**Day 1**: Welcome and Overview • Expedition Focus Review • Research Direction Breakouts • Breakout Reports • Report on Surveys of Activities • Funded Research Projects Review/Introduction • Education and Outreach Review • Funded Education Projects • Knowledge and Technology Transfer • Education and Outreach and Technology Transfer Breakouts • BBQ!\n\n**Day 2**: GEM Undergraduate Course • Research, E&O Breakouts Focusing on What's Next? • Strategic Implementation Planning • Final Breakouts for Impromptu Topics • New Drilling Projects Breakout Followup • EAB Breakout • ExCom Breakout • Final Charges\n\n::: also\nDownload the [final agenda (PDF)](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2011C-DEBIallhandsagenda.pdf)\n:::\n\n## 2015 Sediment and Basement Workshops\n\nIn 2015, the C-DEBI theme workshops were replaced by biome (basement and sediment) workshops integrated across the research themes to review the state of knowledge at the end of Phase 1.\n\n### C-DEBI Basement Workshop, 9-10 July 2015\n\n_Harvard University, Cambridge, MA_\n\n**Organizers:** Jason Sylvan (USC) & Julie Huber (MBL)\n\nThe initial invitation for the workshop summarized the desired outcomes: as the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations (C-DEBI) enters the final stage of Phase I, we are organizing a workshop to synthesize what we have learned about the microbial ecology of subseafloor basement environments, including igneous rocks and crustal fluids. Topics of discussion will include where the bleeding edge of subseafloor crustal microbiology lies, the biggest current obstacles to overcome, commonalities between sites and regimes that have come to light over the last five years (or more), and what questions will be most exciting to address in the coming decade. We are looking for input from microbial ecologists as well as geochemists and petrologists to help synthesize the current research and try to invigorate the community with interdisciplinary goals for the next phase of C-DEBI. Unlike previous C-DEBI workshops, this one will not focus on a specific theme, such as activity or diversity, but will rather look at the entirety of crustal microbiology. We hope you can join us in Boston this July for a few days of stimulating and productive discussions.\n\n::: also\nRead the [workshop report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-E2EjUml5RrdktQRVNzS29iX3A4S2FadmpXZ0d5bGNQQ0Vj/view?usp=sharing)\n:::\n\n### C-DEBI Sediment Workshop, 25-26 June 2015\n\n_University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA_\n\n**Organizers:** Karen Lloyd (University of Tennessee, Knoxville) & Steven D'Hondt (URI)\n\nThe 2015 C-DEBI Sediment Workshop was held at the University of Southern California, June 25-26\\. There were 16 in-person attendees and 2 people participating remotely. During the first part of the first day, each participant gave a short presentation on a research project or interest relevant to the subseafloor sedimentary biosphere. For the remainder of the first day and the second day, the participants engaged in group discussion of the following three questions about the deep subseafloor sedimentary biosphere: 1. What is known? 2. What are the major questions? 3. How can we go about answering these questions?\n\n::: also\nRead the [workshop report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-E2EjUml5RrRzg0WXMzeDB3U0VfUWVrLWpuWVU3a25XOGR3/view?usp=sharing)\n:::\n\n## 2010-2014 Research Theme Team Workshops\n\nIn the initial phase of C-DEBI, the following four themes were the focus of C-DEBI research, providing a conceptual framework for scientific investigation supported by C-DEBI across a broad scientific community: _Activity_, _Extent of Life_, _Limits to Life_, and _Evolution and Survival_. For each of these themes, Theme Team Leaders regularly brought together experts within and outside of C-DEBI to identify new research directions within each theme. Based on these “think tank” conversations, the Theme Team Leaders developed Requests for Proposals for the initial phase of C-DEBI small grants and fellowship programs.\n\n### Research Theme I. Activity in the Deep Subseafloor Biosphere: function & rates of global biogeochemical processes\n\n*Theme Team Leaders:* Wiebke Ziebis (USC, 2010) & Beth Orcutt (Bigelow, 2012-2014)\n\nWhat is the global consequence of microbial activity in the marine deep sediment and crustal biospheres? How quickly, or slowly, do processes occur, and what factors regulate these rates? What types of microbial processes are dominant in different environments, and why? What are cell specific rates of activity in the marine deep biosphere? Through targeted support of research aiming to quantify geographic distributions of subseafloor sedimentary respiration, rates and magnitude of microbial crustal alteration, energy sources and carbon flow, C-DEBI enables robust analyses linking subseafloor processes to global scales and biogeochemical cycles.\n\n::: also\nDownload the [2012 Activity Theme Team Workshop Report](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2012C-DEBIactivity_WorkshopReport.pdf)\nDownload the [2013 Activity Theme Team Workshop Report](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2013_C-DEBI_Activity_Workshop_Report.pdf)\nRead the [2013 Activity Theme Review (Orcutt et al.)](http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fmicb.2013.00189/abstract) in Frontiers in Microbiology\n:::\n\n### Research Theme II. Extent of Life: biomes and the degree of connectivity (biogeography and dispersal)\n\n*Theme Team Leader:* Andreas Teske (UNC, 2010-2014)\n\nOver time, the interplay of microbial dispersal and environmental selection creates a distinct biogeography of microbes in the subseafloor. What microbes take seed where and why? What are the most significant physical and chemical controls of these colonization processes? How similar or different are the resulting microbial ecosystems in the ocean crust and in deep sediment from each other and from the overlying deep ocean? By studying multiple sites and subseafloor habitats, C-DEBI research aims to develop a global model for biogeography of microbes below the seafloor.\n\n::: also\nDownload the [2011 Sediment Microbiology DEBI RCN Meeting Summary](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2011DEBI_SedimentMeetingSummary2.pdf)\nDownload the [Guaymas Basin IODP Pre-proposal (PDF)](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/IODPpreproposal_GuaymasTransect.pdf)\nDownload the [2013 joint Extent Theme Team and Guaymas Drilling Proposal Workshop Report](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2013C-DEBIextentTT-Guaymas_WorkshopReport.pdf)\n:::\n\n### Research Theme III. Limits to Life: extremes and norms of carbon, energy, nutrient, temperature, pressure, pH\n\n*Theme Team Leader:* Tom McCollom (UC Boulder, 2010-2014)\n\nNumerous studies by C-DEBI participants and others continue to show that microbial life is widespread in the subseafloor. At the same time, however, life is not everywhere, and where it does occur it appears to operate at very slow metabolic rates. How do environmental variables such as temperature, pressure, nutrient availability, fluid flow, pore space, etc. limit the distribution and metabolism of microorganisms in the deep subsurface? What defines the boundary where life can no longer exist in the deep subsurface? C-DEBI promotes investigations into the factors that limit the extent and activity of life in the deep subseafloor, including field, laboratory, and theoretical studies.\n\n::: also\nDownload the [2011 Limits To Life Theme Team Workshop Report](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2011C-DEBIL2L_WorkshopReport.pdf)\nDownload the [2014 Limits To Life Theme Team Workshop Report](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2014C-DEBIL2L_Workshop%20report.pdf)\n:::\n\n### Research Theme IV. Evolution and Survival: adaptation, enrichment, and repair\n\n*Theme Team Leaders:* Bill Nelson (USC, 2010-2013) & Julie Huber (2013-2014)\n\nReproduction, change, and selection are necessary elements of any evolutionary trajectory, but we know very little about evolution and adaptation in subseafloor habitats. What are the metabolic drivers that might lead to selection in the subseafloor? In an environment where biomass turnover may occur on a timescale of hundreds to thousands of years, can you actually detect evolutionary changes? How does lateral gene transfer impact evolutionary trajectories in the subseafloor? Through a combination of field and laboratory based measurements, C-DEBI research aims to examine these key questions about microbial evolutionary processes in the subseafloor.\n\n::: also\nDownload the [2011 Evolution Theme Team Workshop Report](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2011C-DEBIevoTT_WorkshopReport.pdf)\nRead the [2012 Evolution Theme Review (Biddle et al.)](http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fmicb.2011.00285/abstract) in Frontiers in Microbiology\nDownload the [2013 Evolution Theme Team Workshop Report](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2013C-DEBIevoTT_WorkshopReport.pdf)\n:::\n\n\n## 2009-2014 DEBI RCN (Research Coordination Network) Meetings\n\nWith the DEBI RCN, we held annual, theme-based meetings to address the research and coordination efforts of the growing deep biosphere community. These meetings enabled scientists and students to exchange ideas in deep biosphere studies, to learn about practical developments and study opportunities in the field, and to coordinate research and education activities. Each meeting was part **scientific conference** and part **training workshop**, both parts focused on a specific theme within deep biosphere research. These key themes included microbiology in sediments and basement rock, organic geochemistry and biosignatures, bioenergetics, hydrogeology, and drilling and sampling technology.\n\n**2009 Subseafloor Ocean Biosphere and Borehole Observatory Science DEBI RCN Meeting**\n*Organizers:* Jim Cowen (UH), Brian Glazer (UH), Andrew Fisher (UCSC), Jan Amend (WUStL)\nCo-sponsored by USSSP\n\n::: also\nDownload [meeting report (PDF)](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2009DEBI_CORKreport.pdf)\n:::\n\n**2011 Deep Biosphere Sediment Microbiology DEBI RCN Meeting**\n*Organizers:* Andreas Teske (UNC), Jennifer Biddle (UDel), Matthew Schrenk (ECU)\nCo-sponsored by USSSP and NASA Astrobiology Institute\n\n::: also\nDownload [meeting report (PDF)](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2011DEBI_SedimentMeetingSummary2.pdf)\n:::\n\n**2012 Ocean Crust Processes and Consequences for Life DEBI RCN Meeting**\n*Organizers:* Heiner Villinger, and Ulla Röhl, and Wolfgang Bach (all at U Bremen)\nCo-sponsored by German Research Foundation (DFG) and the German IODP at BGR\n\n::: also\nDownload [meeting report (PDF)](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2012DEBI_CrustMeetingSummary.pdf)\n:::\n\n**2014 Bioenergetics and Subsurface Metabolisms DEBI RCN Meeting**\n*Organizers:* Jan Amend and Doug LaRowe (both at USC)\n\n::: also\nDownload [meeting report (PDF)](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2014RCN_Workshop Report_b.pdf)\n:::\n\n## 2008 Kick Off Workshop\n\n*Organizers:* Katrina Edwards and Beth Orcutt (both at USC)\n\nTHE WORKSHOP that started it ALL!!!

We hope you can join us in Boston this July for a few days of stimulating and productive discussions.\n\n::: also\nRead the [workshop report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-E2EjUml5RrdktQRVNzS29iX3A4S2FadmpXZ0d5bGNQQ0Vj/view?usp=sharing)\n:::\n\n### C-DEBI Sediment Workshop, 25-26 June 2015\n\n_University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA_\n\n**Organizers:** Karen Lloyd (University of Tennessee, Knoxville) & Steven D'Hondt (URI)\n\nThe 2015 C-DEBI Sediment Workshop was held at the University of Southern California, June 25-26\\. There were 16 in-person attendees and 2 people participating remotely. During the first part of the first day, each participant gave a short presentation on a research project or interest relevant to the subseafloor sedimentary biosphere. For the remainder of the first day and the second day, the participants engaged in group discussion of the following three questions about the deep subseafloor sedimentary biosphere: 1. What is known? 2. What are the major questions? 3. How can we go about answering these questions?\n\n::: also\nRead the [workshop report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-E2EjUml5RrRzg0WXMzeDB3U0VfUWVrLWpuWVU3a25XOGR3/view?usp=sharing)\n:::\n\n## 2010-2014 Research Theme Team Workshops\n\nIn the initial phase of C-DEBI, the following four themes were the focus of C-DEBI research, providing a conceptual framework for scientific investigation supported by C-DEBI across a broad scientific community: _Activity_, _Extent of Life_, _Limits to Life_, and _Evolution and Survival_. For each of these themes, Theme Team Leaders regularly brought together experts within and outside of C-DEBI to identify new research directions within each theme. Based on these “think tank” conversations, the Theme Team Leaders developed Requests for Proposals for the initial phase of C-DEBI small grants and fellowship programs.\n\n### Research Theme I. Activity in the Deep Subseafloor Biosphere: function & rates of global biogeochemical processes\n\n*Theme Team Leaders:* Wiebke Ziebis (USC, 2010) & Beth Orcutt (Bigelow, 2012-2014)\n\nWhat is the global consequence of microbial activity in the marine deep sediment and crustal biospheres? How quickly, or slowly, do processes occur, and what factors regulate these rates? What types of microbial processes are dominant in different environments, and why? What are cell specific rates of activity in the marine deep biosphere? Through targeted support of research aiming to quantify geographic distributions of subseafloor sedimentary respiration, rates and magnitude of microbial crustal alteration, energy sources and carbon flow, C-DEBI enables robust analyses linking subseafloor processes to global scales and biogeochemical cycles.\n\n::: also\nDownload the [2012 Activity Theme Team Workshop Report](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2012C-DEBIactivity_WorkshopReport.pdf)\nDownload the [2013 Activity Theme Team Workshop Report](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2013_C-DEBI_Activity_Workshop_Report.pdf)\nRead the [2013 Activity Theme Review (Orcutt et al.)](http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fmicb.2013.00189/abstract) in Frontiers in Microbiology\n:::\n\n### Research Theme II. Extent of Life: biomes and the degree of connectivity (biogeography and dispersal)\n\n*Theme Team Leader:* Andreas Teske (UNC, 2010-2014)\n\nOver time, the interplay of microbial dispersal and environmental selection creates a distinct biogeography of microbes in the subseafloor. What microbes take seed where and why? What are the most significant physical and chemical controls of these colonization processes? How similar or different are the resulting microbial ecosystems in the ocean crust and in deep sediment from each other and from the overlying deep ocean? By studying multiple sites and subseafloor habitats, C-DEBI research aims to develop a global model for biogeography of microbes below the seafloor.\n\n::: also\nDownload the [2011 Sediment Microbiology DEBI RCN Meeting Summary](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2011DEBI_SedimentMeetingSummary2.pdf)\nDownload the [Guaymas Basin IODP Pre-proposal (PDF)](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/IODPpreproposal_GuaymasTransect.pdf)\nDownload the [2013 joint Extent Theme Team and Guaymas Drilling Proposal Workshop Report](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2013C-DEBIextentTT-Guaymas_WorkshopReport.pdf)\n:::\n\n### Research Theme III. Limits to Life: extremes and norms of carbon, energy, nutrient, temperature, pressure, pH\n\n*Theme Team Leader:* Tom McCollom (UC Boulder, 2010-2014)\n\nNumerous studies by C-DEBI participants and others continue to show that microbial life is widespread in the subseafloor. At the same time, however, life is not everywhere, and where it does occur it appears to operate at very slow metabolic rates. How do environmental variables such as temperature, pressure, nutrient availability, fluid flow, pore space, etc. limit the distribution and metabolism of microorganisms in the deep subsurface? What defines the boundary where life can no longer exist in the deep subsurface? C-DEBI promotes investigations into the factors that limit the extent and activity of life in the deep subseafloor, including field, laboratory, and theoretical studies.\n\n::: also\nDownload the [2011 Limits To Life Theme Team Workshop Report](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2011C-DEBIL2L_WorkshopReport.pdf)\nDownload the [2014 Limits To Life Theme Team Workshop Report](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2014C-DEBIL2L_Workshop%20report.pdf)\n:::\n\n### Research Theme IV. Evolution and Survival: adaptation, enrichment, and repair\n\n*Theme Team Leaders:* Bill Nelson (USC, 2010-2013) & Julie Huber (2013-2014)\n\nReproduction, change, and selection are necessary elements of any evolutionary trajectory, but we know very little about evolution and adaptation in subseafloor habitats. What are the metabolic drivers that might lead to selection in the subseafloor? In an environment where biomass turnover may occur on a timescale of hundreds to thousands of years, can you actually detect evolutionary changes? How does lateral gene transfer impact evolutionary trajectories in the subseafloor? Through a combination of field and laboratory based measurements, C-DEBI research aims to examine these key questions about microbial evolutionary processes in the subseafloor.\n\n::: also\nDownload the [2011 Evolution Theme Team Workshop Report](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2011C-DEBIevoTT_WorkshopReport.pdf)\nRead the [2012 Evolution Theme Review (Biddle et al.)](http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fmicb.2011.00285/abstract) in Frontiers in Microbiology\nDownload the [2013 Evolution Theme Team Workshop Report](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2013C-DEBIevoTT_WorkshopReport.pdf)\n:::\n\n\n## 2009-2014 DEBI RCN (Research Coordination Network) Meetings\n\nWith the DEBI RCN, we held annual, theme-based meetings to address the research and coordination efforts of the growing deep biosphere community. These meetings enabled scientists and students to exchange ideas in deep biosphere studies, to learn about practical developments and study opportunities in the field, and to coordinate research and education activities. Each meeting was part **scientific conference** and part **training workshop**, both parts focused on a specific theme within deep biosphere research. These key themes included microbiology in sediments and basement rock, organic geochemistry and biosignatures, bioenergetics, hydrogeology, and drilling and sampling technology.\n\n**2009 Subseafloor Ocean Biosphere and Borehole Observatory Science DEBI RCN Meeting**\n*Organizers:* Jim Cowen (UH), Brian Glazer (UH), Andrew Fisher (UCSC), Jan Amend (WUStL)\nCo-sponsored by USSSP\n\n::: also\nDownload [meeting report (PDF)](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2009DEBI_CORKreport.pdf)\n:::\n\n**2011 Deep Biosphere Sediment Microbiology DEBI RCN Meeting**\n*Organizers:* Andreas Teske (UNC), Jennifer Biddle (UDel), Matthew Schrenk (ECU)\nCo-sponsored by USSSP and NASA Astrobiology Institute\n\n::: also\nDownload [meeting report (PDF)](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2011DEBI_SedimentMeetingSummary2.pdf)\n:::\n\n**2012 Ocean Crust Processes and Consequences for Life DEBI RCN Meeting**\n*Organizers:* Heiner Villinger, and Ulla Röhl, and Wolfgang Bach (all at U Bremen)\nCo-sponsored by German Research Foundation (DFG) and the German IODP at BGR\n\n::: also\nDownload [meeting report (PDF)](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2012DEBI_CrustMeetingSummary.pdf)\n:::\n\n**2014 Bioenergetics and Subsurface Metabolisms DEBI RCN Meeting**\n*Organizers:* Jan Amend and Doug LaRowe (both at USC)\n\n::: also\nDownload [meeting report (PDF)](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2014RCN_Workshop Report_b.pdf)\n:::\n\n## 2008 Kick Off Workshop\n\n*Organizers:* Katrina Edwards and Beth Orcutt (both at USC)\n\nTHE WORKSHOP that started it ALL!!!
