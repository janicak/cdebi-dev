Since C-DEBI's inception in the fall of 2010, we have supported semiannual calls for proposals for our <a href="http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/research-activities/research-support/research-grants/">Research Grants</a>, <a href="http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/education-diversity/education-small-grants/">Education Grants</a>, and <a href="http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/research-activities/research-support/fellowships/">Graduate and Postdoctoral Fellowships</a>. As we begin the second phase of our NSF Science and Technology Center award, our first call will be due 1/31/2016.</p>
<p>###What is the Source of C-DEBI Funding? Am I Eligible?
C-DEBI is a National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center administratively based at the University of Southern California (USC). Our Center is funded by NSF's Division of Ocean Sciences (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0939564">OCE award 0939564</a>) Geosciences program (CFDA 47.050). The applicant's home institution must be a US institution able to receive NSF funding as a subaward from USC. The home institution's Sponsored Research Office must submit an institutional letter of intent stating the contact at the institution who will be receiving the award on behalf of the institution.</p>
<p>C-DEBI values a diverse research environment and encourages proposals from applicants who would help to improve diversity in C-DEBI and STEM fields.</p>
<p>###What is the Frequency of the Proposal Calls?
As we begin the second phase of our NSF Science and Technology Center award, our first annual call will be due 1/31/2016.</p>
<p>###Who Develops the Proposal Calls?
The research calls are developed by the <a href="http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/about-our-center/people/">C-DEBI Executive Committee</a> (ExCom). The education call is developed by the <a href="http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/about-our-center/people/">Education Director</a>.</p>
<p>###What are the Review Criteria?
Only research proposals that clearly articulate the relevance of the proposed work to C-DEBI <a href="http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/research-activities/research-themes/">research themes</a> and are rated highly under scientific criteria are likely contenders for funding.</p>
<p>###Small Grants and Fellowships Proposal Review Criteria</p>
<ol>
<li>Alignment and Relevancy with C-DEBI Phase II Goals and Themes
<ul>
<li>Primary aspect: How closely does the research topic align with C-DEBI goals?</li>
<li>Primary aspect: Is the relevancy particularly well articulated and connected to proposed activities?</li>
<li>Secondary aspect: Does the proposed work correlate with research themes specifically mentioned in Phase II proposal?</li>
<li>Secondary aspect: Have proponents not mentioned something that is highly relevant?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Will this project greatly advance our understanding of the deep subseafloor biosphere?</li>
<li>How qualified is the applicant to do this research?</li>
<li>Can this project be completed in the time proposed?</li>
<li>Does this project rely on samples or data that are not yet in hand?</li>
<li>Does the proposal contain a clear statement that the samples/data are available and not in conflict with other planned or active research? (i.e. Are samples/data under moratorium? If so, has explicit permission been given to access the samples and/or data?) (Yes/No/Of Concern/Not of Concern)</li>
<li>Is the budget reasonable and will the proponents be able to accomplish the proposed goals with the given budget? In the case of a proposal that is requesting more than $80K, will the additional funding make a substantial difference to the proposed work? Will the additional funding contribute linearly to the outcome (e.g., more samples analyzed) or follow a fundamentally different but related path?</li>
<li>To what extent does the project entrain researchers who are in an early stage of their career and/or new to the C-DEBI community?</li>
<li>Does the proposal contain a plan for making data public and accessible in accordance with the C-DEBI Data Management Plan?</li>
<li>For Fellowships: How well do the proposal’s Broader Impacts activities emphasize the integration of research and education focusing on early career professional development?</li>
</ol>
<p>###Education Grants Proposal Review Criteria
Education grants will fund the development of educational opportunities and materials that are pertinent to deep biosphere research in the subseafloor environment with criteria identified in the call.</p>
<p>###Who is on My Review Panel?
Conflict of interest is considered at every step of the review process. See our <a href="http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/about-our-center/ethics-policy/">Ethics Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Proposals for the next research call will be reviewed by the <a href="http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/about-our-center/people/">C-DEBI Executive Committee &amp; Senior Scientists</a> who may request input from members of the community to address technical aspects of a particular proposal.</p>
<p>Proposals for the next education call will be reviewed by the <a href="http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/about-our-center/people/">C-DEBI Education and Outreach Steering Committee</a>. Review summaries will be returned to every applicant.</p>
<p>###Will My Proposal be Funded?
C-DEBI intends to fund 7-8 research proposals in response to the next call in the range of $50,000-$80,000 each. In rare cases, we will consider awarding up to an additional $20,000, but this will require specific justification and a separate budget indicating how the additional funding increment would be used.</p>
<p>C-DEBI intends to fund 1-2 education proposals in response to the next call up to $50,000.</p>
<p>Our previous annual budget for our grants and fellowships was for 10 graduate student and postdoctoral fellowships each (including 2nd year renewals), 10 research grants and 2 education grants. ExCom made final decisions based on the Review Chair recommendations, evaluations, and funding available to support outstanding research and education projects. Our grants programs had become very competitive: funding rates of the previous recent call were 33-50% for new graduate student and postdoctoral fellowships, 25% for the research grants and 40% for the outreach grants.</p>
<p>###What is the Timeline for Funding?
We anticipate making decisions on funding by 2/29/16 for successful proposals to start 4/1/16 in alignment with our funding periodicity, <em>however a delayed start date for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships is possible and will be a consideration in the review process</em>.</p>

Will this project greatly advance our understanding of the deep subseafloor biosphere?\n3.  How qualified is the applicant to do this research?\n4.  Can this project be completed in the time proposed?\n5.  Does this project rely on samples or data that are not yet in hand?\n6.  Does the proposal contain a clear statement that the samples/data are available and not in conflict with other planned or active research? (i.e. Are samples/data under moratorium? If so, has explicit permission been given to access the samples and/or data?) (Yes/No/Of Concern/Not of Concern)\n7.  Is the budget reasonable and will the proponents be able to accomplish the proposed goals with the given budget? In the case of a proposal that is requesting more than $80K, will the additional funding make a substantial difference to the proposed work? Will the additional funding contribute linearly to the outcome (e.g., more samples analyzed) or follow a fundamentally different but related path?\n8.  To what extent does the project entrain researchers who are in an early stage of their career and/or new to the C-DEBI community?\n9.  Does the proposal contain a plan for making data public and accessible in accordance with the C-DEBI Data Management Plan?\n10.  For Fellowships: How well do the proposal’s Broader Impacts activities emphasize the integration of research and education focusing on early career professional development?\n\n###Education Grants Proposal Review Criteria\nEducation grants will fund the development of educational opportunities and materials that are pertinent to deep biosphere research in the subseafloor environment with criteria identified in the call.\n\n###Who is on My Review Panel?\nConflict of interest is considered at every step of the review process. See our [Ethics Policy](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/about-our-center/ethics-policy/).\n\nProposals for the next research call will be reviewed by the [C-DEBI Executive Committee & Senior Scientists](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/about-our-center/people/) who may request input from members of the community to address technical aspects of a particular proposal.\n\nProposals for the next education call will be reviewed by the [C-DEBI Education and Outreach Steering Committee](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/about-our-center/people/). Review summaries will be returned to every applicant.\n\n###Will My Proposal be Funded?\nC-DEBI intends to fund 7-8 research proposals in response to the next call in the range of $50,000-$80,000 each. In rare cases, we will consider awarding up to an additional $20,000, but this will require specific justification and a separate budget indicating how the additional funding increment would be used.\n\nC-DEBI intends to fund 1-2 education proposals in response to the next call up to $50,000.\n\nOur previous annual budget for our grants and fellowships was for 10 graduate student and postdoctoral fellowships each (including 2nd year renewals), 10 research grants and 2 education grants. ExCom made final decisions based on the Review Chair recommendations, evaluations, and funding available to support outstanding research and education projects. Our grants programs had become very competitive: funding rates of the previous recent call were 33-50% for new graduate student and postdoctoral fellowships, 25% for the research grants and 40% for the outreach grants.\n\n###What is the Timeline for Funding?\nWe anticipate making decisions on funding by 2/29/16 for successful proposals to start 4/1/16 in alignment with our funding periodicity, _however a delayed start date for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships is possible and will be a consideration in the review process_.\n\nContact [Rosalynn Sylvan](mailto:rosalyyl@usc.edu), Managing Director, with your additional questions!\n\n---\n::: also\nSee [what projects have been funded](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/research-activities/funded-projects/)\n:::\n","__filename":"research/grant-programs-faq.md","__url":"/research/grant-programs-faq/","__resourceUrl":"/research/grant-programs-faq/index.html","__dataUrl":"/research/grant-programs-faq/index.html.9ff415bafe2ea7435196d6a361e31ba5.json","type":"Page"}}}</script><script data-react-helmet="true" src="https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js"></script><script data-react-helmet="true" src="https://use.typekit.net/wdw6szy.js"></script><script data-react-helmet="true">try{Typekit.load({ async: true });}catch(e){}</script><script src="/cdebi-dev/phenomic.browser.27319ecf2ee2575e3b98.js"></script></body></html>
