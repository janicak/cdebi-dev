With age, the valleys fill with sediment, but exposed basalt is commonplace, allowing seawater to ventilate and cool the crust.</p>\n<p>The North Pond project was envisioned to investigate the origin, nature, and activity of microbial communities within basaltic basement below an isolated sediment &quot;pond.&quot; NP, which is located on the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 22°45'N and 46°05'W and overlies 8Ma-old crust, was chosen in part because the site has been explored for decades. These exploratory studies have provided a geologic and hydrologic context for microbial studies.</p>\n<p>Most recently, subseafloor observatories (CORKs) were installed at NP during <a href=\"http://iodp.tamu.edu/scienceops/expeditions/midatlantic_ridge_microbio.html\">IODP Expedition 336</a> (Sept. - Nov. 2011) to collect and monitor active, low temperature, oxygenated fluids that advect vigorously through basaltic basement and to take the first step in conducting manipulative experiments within this natural setting.</p>\n<p>The three guiding questions for research at NP are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the nature of microbial communities harbored in young ridge flanks and what is their role in ocean crust alteration?</li>\n<li>Are these communities unique, particularly in comparison with seafloor and sedimentary communities?</li>\n<li>Where do deep-seated microbial communities come from (sediment, rock, seawater, other)?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To address these questions, and many more detailed ones, a team of international researchers undertook a site survey expedition prior to IODP Expedition 336, during which material was recovered (sediment and crustal rocks) and three borehole observatories were installed (CORKs). Five months later (April 2012) an ROV expedition deployed another observatory (CORK-Lite), collected fluids from the CORKs, deployed experiments, and recovered pressure data. A second ROV expedition in April 2014 collected more CORK fluids, recovered seafloor experiments, and deployed some additional ones. Much of the cost for this fieldwork was supported by our German colleagues, the IODP, and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.</p>\n<p>Results completed this year from samples and data recovered during these four expeditions continue to shed light on all four Phase 1 C-DEBI themes.

Lister (1972) postulated that these differences resulted from the cooling of the crust by the circulation of seawater. The magnitude of this circulation is large, redistributing 10 TW (one fourth) of the Earth’s heat loss. Then, in 1977, the first seafloor hydrothermal system was discovered; however, such systems, driven by the intrusion of magma, account for 20% of the total convective heat loss from oceanic crust. The remaining heat loss is transported on the ridge flanks at much cooler temperatures, yet with a net fluid flux that is commensurate with that of rivers. Given this magnitude of fluid flow, it has been postulated that even a minimal (1-5%) loss or gain from seawater-crustal exchange could impact global geochemical budgets in the ocean; however, until recently such a representative system had yet to be sampled.</p>\n<p>Off the west coast of Costa Rica on 23 Ma-old crust lies the Dorado Outcrop, a small (0.5 km wide by 2 km long and 150 m high) basaltic outcrop that that trends southeast-northwest and is characteristic of typical ridge flank hydrothermal systems. In 2013 we surveyed DO using the autonomous underwater vehicle Sentry and the remotely operated vehicle Jason II (AT26-09) (<a href=\"http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/DoradoCruiseReport2013.pdf\">cruise report</a>). Surveys generated a bathymetric map from which visual and thermal surveys located sites where crustal fluids vented and placed them within a geologic context. The outcrop consists of basaltic pillows and sheet flows with linear faults that are tens to hundreds of meters long and in the general trend of the outcrop. Surprisingly hydrothermal fluids do not currently vent from these linear features.</p>\n<p>Instead, diffuse hydrothermal activity was identified from thermal anomalies determined from temperature probes mounted on the ROV and AUV. Such anomalies guided closer inspection with a manipulator-held device. Over one hundred thermal measurements were made with the warmest recorded temperature of 12.3°C, well above the bottom water temperature (1.85°C). Most of the hydrothermal flow occurred ubiquitously along the southwestern portion of the outcrop with the most vigorous site that spans hundreds of square meters (Marker K). In 2013, spring samples were collected and continuous fluid samplers (OsmoSamplers), and temperature loggers were deployed. Because of the diffuse nature of the springs, we developed a novel syringe-based fluid sampler that we used in 2014 with the submersible Alvin during which we recovered samplers and sensors, collected additional fluids, and measured dissolved oxygen in situ (<a href=\"http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/Dorado%20Outcrop%202014%20Cruise%20Report%20reduced.pdf\">cruise report</a>).</p>\n<div class=\"also\">\n<p>For a summary of recent accomplishments, see the <a href=\"http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2015C-DEBIAnnualReport_forweb.pdf\">2015 C-DEBI Annual Report</a></p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"dorado-outcrop-expedition-history\"><a class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\" href=\"#dorado-outcrop-expedition-history\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a> Dorado Outcrop Expedition History</h3>\n<p>December 7 - December 23, 2013\n<a href=\"http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/DoradoCruiseReport2013.pdf\">UNOLS Expedition AT26-09: <em>Discovery, sampling, and quantification of flows from cool yet massive ridge flank hydrothermal springs on Dorado Outcrop, eastern Pacific Ocean</em></a>\n<strong>Chief scientist:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.sfos.uaf.edu/directory/faculty/wheat/\">C.

With age, the valleys fill with sediment, but exposed basalt is commonplace, allowing seawater to ventilate and cool the crust.\n\nThe North Pond project was envisioned to investigate the origin, nature, and activity of microbial communities within basaltic basement below an isolated sediment \"pond.\" NP, which is located on the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 22°45'N and 46°05'W and overlies 8Ma-old crust, was chosen in part because the site has been explored for decades.

Five months later (April 2012) an ROV expedition deployed another observatory (CORK-Lite), collected fluids from the CORKs, deployed experiments, and recovered pressure data.

Lister (1972) postulated that these differences resulted from the cooling of the crust by the circulation of seawater. The magnitude of this circulation is large, redistributing 10 TW (one fourth) of the Earth’s heat loss. Then, in 1977, the first seafloor hydrothermal system was discovered; however, such systems, driven by the intrusion of magma, account for 20% of the total convective heat loss from oceanic crust. The remaining heat loss is transported on the ridge flanks at much cooler temperatures, yet with a net fluid flux that is commensurate with that of rivers. Given this magnitude of fluid flow, it has been postulated that even a minimal (1-5%) loss or gain from seawater-crustal exchange could impact global geochemical budgets in the ocean; however, until recently such a representative system had yet to be sampled.\n\nOff the west coast of Costa Rica on 23 Ma-old crust lies the Dorado Outcrop, a small (0.5 km wide by 2 km long and 150 m high) basaltic outcrop that that trends southeast-northwest and is characteristic of typical ridge flank hydrothermal systems. In 2013 we surveyed DO using the autonomous underwater vehicle Sentry and the remotely operated vehicle Jason II (AT26-09) ([cruise report](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/DoradoCruiseReport2013.pdf)). Surveys generated a bathymetric map from which visual and thermal surveys located sites where crustal fluids vented and placed them within a geologic context. The outcrop consists of basaltic pillows and sheet flows with linear faults that are tens to hundreds of meters long and in the general trend of the outcrop. Surprisingly hydrothermal fluids do not currently vent from these linear features.\n\nInstead, diffuse hydrothermal activity was identified from thermal anomalies determined from temperature probes mounted on the ROV and AUV. Such anomalies guided closer inspection with a manipulator-held device. Over one hundred thermal measurements were made with the warmest recorded temperature of 12.3°C, well above the bottom water temperature (1.85°C). Most of the hydrothermal flow occurred ubiquitously along the southwestern portion of the outcrop with the most vigorous site that spans hundreds of square meters (Marker K). In 2013, spring samples were collected and continuous fluid samplers (OsmoSamplers), and temperature loggers were deployed. Because of the diffuse nature of the springs, we developed a novel syringe-based fluid sampler that we used in 2014 with the submersible Alvin during which we recovered samplers and sensors, collected additional fluids, and measured dissolved oxygen in situ ([cruise report](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/Dorado%20Outcrop%202014%20Cruise%20Report%20reduced.pdf)).\n\n::: also\nFor a summary of recent accomplishments, see the [2015 C-DEBI Annual Report](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2015C-DEBIAnnualReport_forweb.pdf)\n:::\n\n\n### Dorado Outcrop Expedition History\n\nDecember 7 - December 23, 2013\n[UNOLS Expedition AT26-09: *Discovery, sampling, and quantification of flows from cool yet massive ridge flank hydrothermal springs on Dorado Outcrop, eastern Pacific Ocean*](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/DoradoCruiseReport2013.pdf)\n**Chief scientist:** [C.

Projects using data and field samples from this region have included two IODP expeditions (301 and 327); long-term borehole observatories (CORKs) used for testing, monitoring and sampling; and numerous non-drilling oceanographic expeditions using oceanographic ships and submersibles/ROVs, laboratory studies using materials and associated microbial cultures, and theoretical and computational experiments.

The primary purposes of this project are to:\n\n*   Document the nature of microbial communities and test the energetic limit to life in the most food-poor deep-sea sediment\n*   Test the influence of basement age and sediment thickness on basement habitability, microbial communities, and the hydrologic evolution of crustal basalt.\n\nThis project addresses fundamental questions about subseafloor life, including the following:\n\n*   Is there a lower limit to life in oligotrophic subseafloor sediment?\n*   Are the communities in mid-gyre subseafloor sediments uniquely structured (how do these communities compare to those previously studied nearer to the continents)?\n*   Is the primary electron donor organic matter from the surface world or hydrogen from _in situ_ radioactive splitting of water?\n*   Do microbial activities and composition vary with properties of the surface world, such as sea surface chlorophyll concentrations or organic flux to the seafloor?\n*   Is microbial activity sustainable in subseafloor basalt by mineral oxidation (_e.g.,_ oxidation of iron in the basaltic minerals) or other processes for tens of Myrs after basalt formation?\n\nAnswering these questions will help to achieve all three of the broader C-DEBI themes/objectives.\n\nFor a summary of recent accomplishments, see the [2015 C-DEBI Annual Report](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2015C-DEBIAnnualReport_forweb.pdf)\n:::\n\n### South Pacific Gyre Expedition History\n\nOctober 9 - December 13, 2010\n[IODP Expedition 329: *Life beneath the seafloor of the South Pacific Gyre*](http://publications.iodp.org/preliminary_report/329/)\n**Co-chief scientists:** Steven D'Hondt and Fumio Inagaki\n\n==Cruise updates?==\n\n::: also\nSee the [South Pacific Gyre IODP Drilling Proposal](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/IODP_SPG-DHondt.pdf)\n:::\n\n## Dorado Outcrop (DO)\n\n**Led by:** [Geoff Wheat](http://www.sfos.uaf.edu/directory/faculty/wheat/), University of Alaska, Fairbanks\n\n### Background\n\nThe Dorado Outcrop program builds on decades of research that observed differences between measured and theoretical heat flow values in the ocean crust. Lister (1972) postulated that these differences resulted from the cooling of the crust by the circulation of seawater. The magnitude of this circulation is large, redistributing 10 TW (one fourth) of the Earth’s heat loss. Then, in 1977, the first seafloor hydrothermal system was discovered; however, such systems, driven by the intrusion of magma, account for 20% of the total convective heat loss from oceanic crust. The remaining heat loss is transported on the ridge flanks at much cooler temperatures, yet with a net fluid flux that is commensurate with that of rivers. Given this magnitude of fluid flow, it has been postulated that even a minimal (1-5%) loss or gain from seawater-crustal exchange could impact global geochemical budgets in the ocean; however, until recently such a representative system had yet to be sampled.\n\nOff the west coast of Costa Rica on 23 Ma-old crust lies the Dorado Outcrop, a small (0.5 km wide by 2 km long and 150 m high) basaltic outcrop that that trends southeast-northwest and is characteristic of typical ridge flank hydrothermal systems. In 2013 we surveyed DO using the autonomous underwater vehicle Sentry and the remotely operated vehicle Jason II (AT26-09) ([cruise report](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/DoradoCruiseReport2013.pdf)). Surveys generated a bathymetric map from which visual and thermal surveys located sites where crustal fluids vented and placed them within a geologic context. The outcrop consists of basaltic pillows and sheet flows with linear faults that are tens to hundreds of meters long and in the general trend of the outcrop. Surprisingly hydrothermal fluids do not currently vent from these linear features.\n\nInstead, diffuse hydrothermal activity was identified from thermal anomalies determined from temperature probes mounted on the ROV and AUV. Such anomalies guided closer inspection with a manipulator-held device. Over one hundred thermal measurements were made with the warmest recorded temperature of 12.3°C, well above the bottom water temperature (1.85°C). Most of the hydrothermal flow occurred ubiquitously along the southwestern portion of the outcrop with the most vigorous site that spans hundreds of square meters (Marker K). In 2013, spring samples were collected and continuous fluid samplers (OsmoSamplers), and temperature loggers were deployed. Because of the diffuse nature of the springs, we developed a novel syringe-based fluid sampler that we used in 2014 with the submersible Alvin during which we recovered samplers and sensors, collected additional fluids, and measured dissolved oxygen in situ ([cruise report](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/Dorado%20Outcrop%202014%20Cruise%20Report%20reduced.pdf)).\n\n::: also\nFor a summary of recent accomplishments, see the [2015 C-DEBI Annual Report](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/2015C-DEBIAnnualReport_forweb.pdf)\n:::\n\n\n### Dorado Outcrop Expedition History\n\nDecember 7 - December 23, 2013\n[UNOLS Expedition AT26-09: *Discovery, sampling, and quantification of flows from cool yet massive ridge flank hydrothermal springs on Dorado Outcrop, eastern Pacific Ocean*](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/DoradoCruiseReport2013.pdf)\n**Chief scientist:** [C.
