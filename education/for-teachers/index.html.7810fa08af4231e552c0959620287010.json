The online toolkits kits were designed to be aligned with specific community college course subjects and include materials and information that instructors can use to make connections between the topics in their curriculum and C-DEBI research, practices, or technology.\n\n**Special Issue of _Current: The Journal of Marine Education_ Featuring the Outreach of Marine NSF Science and Technology Centers**  \nA special issue of Current was sponsored by three National Science Foundation Science and Technology Centers (STCs) that focus on oceanography: C-DEBI, CMOP, and C-MORE. This issue published in 2013 introduces these STCs that focus on ocean and coastal environments and provides examples of their educational outreach. The C-DEBI articles include:\n\n*    [STCs Deliver New Oceanographic Concepts to Educators (PDF)](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/C-DEBIcurrent2013_Spence%20and%20Thomas.pdf)]\n*   [Microbes: Out of the Classroom and into the Field (PDF)](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/C-DEBIcurrent2013_Schroeder%20and%20Joseph.pdf)]\n*   [The \"Adopt-A-Microbe\" Project: A Multi-Disciplinary Science Curriculum for Middle School Students (PDF)](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/C-DEBIcurrent2013_Orcutt%20et%20al.pdf)]\n*   [RETINA: Illuminating Elementary Scientists with STEM Modules (PDF)](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/C-DEBIcurrent2013_Wheat%20et%20al.pdf)]\n*   [Capitalizing on Expertise in Marine Education and Outreach to Broaden Impacts (PDF)](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/C-DEBIcurrent2013_Girguis%20et%20al.pdf)]\n\n**[Adopt-A-Microbe (AAM)](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/adoptamicrobe/)**  \nThe ship-to-shore Adopt-A-Microbe Project was created by Dr. Beth Orcutt (scientist at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Maine) to raise awareness of microscopic life - \"microbes\" - living in the deep marine subsurface to middle school audiences while engaging them in the science of the ocean-drilling program. In collaboration with the Consortium for Ocean Leadership's Deep Earth Academy, the AAM project is being made into a stand-alone curriculum package to be used in the classroom, independent of whether an expedition is in progress at sea.
