The Metcalf Institute for Marine &amp; Environmental Reporting has developed a series of Research Backgrounders and a C-DEBI Experts List ??? shoud/can the backgrounders and expert list be updated for phase 2? ??? to communicate exciting developments in our research of the marine deep biosphere to the journalism and science-writing communities as well as the general public. Supported through a C-DEBI Education and Outreach Grant, these scientifically-vetted resources including a dedicated insight into each of the C-DEBI research themes are intended to assist journalists in their efforts to understand and report on these complex but broadly significant findings.</p>
<p><strong><a href="../community/nss.md">Networked Speaker Series</a></strong>
C-DEBI is a “networked” Science and Technology Center, gathering expertise, ideas, and participation from institutions across the U.S. and around the world. C-DEBI runs the Networked Speaker Series as one means to enhance communication and the exchange of ideas via short (30 minute) presentations with time for questions and discussion. The series is presented live online for remote participants, and is recorded and available on the website for those unable to &quot;attend&quot; the live events.</p>

<p>Explore the hidden wonders of the deep continental slope of the northern Gulf of Mexico from offshore Mississippi to Texas: its bubbling mud volcanoes, quiet brine lakes, seafloor gas hydrates, oil seep sites, and also the seafloor near the Macondo wellhead at over 1500 meters depth, will be visited by deepsea submersible Alvin, its pilots and science observers. Follow the <a href="http://teskelab2014.wordpress.com/">cruise blog</a> March 29 – April 23, 2014 to explore and document the deep Gulf of Mexico ecosystem, its lasting damage and beginning recovery almost four years after the Deepwater Horizon blowout.</p>

<p>We returned to <a href="http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/research-activities/major-field-sites/north-pond/">North Pond</a> in 2011, a site located in the very middle of the Atlantic Ocean, to investigate the microbiology of this location which has been studied nearly continuously for its geological, geophysical, and hydrological characteristics since first drilled in 1975/1976.  See the blog from the <a href="http://northpondexpedition.usc.edu/">first expedition</a> in 2009 and <a href="http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/return-to-northpond/">Return to North Pond Expedition 336 blog</a> linked to <em>Scientific American</em>.

<p>Scientists and educators on the Hydrogeology at <a href="http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/research-activities/major-field-sites/juan-de-fuca/">Juan de Fuca</a> Expedition (Summer 2011) explored how water flows in the earth's crust beneath the seafloor, and examined geochemistry, rock alteration and microbes living in the seafloor - all off the west coast of the United States. This expedition is a direct follow-on from IODP Expedition 327 (2010), when subseafloor observatories (CORKs) were placed in the seafloor on the Juan de Fuca ridge. The returning expedition to these installations used the Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) JASON to download data, retrieve samples, and make any necessary repairs to on-going experiments. See the Expedition Hubs (<a href="http://joidesresolution.org/node/1905">2011</a> and <a href="http://joidesresolution.org/node/1154">2010</a>) and the Adopt-A-Microbe activities (<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/adoptamicrobe3/">2011</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/adoptamicrobe/">2010</a>).</p>

<p>The South Pacific Gyre Microbiology Expedition (2010) penetrated a total of 630 m at seven different drill sites to define the physical and chemical limits of subseafloor microbial life in tectonic and oceanographic settings not yet explored!  See the <a href="http://joidesresolution.org/node/1412">Expedition Hub</a> and <a href="http://adoptamicrobe329.blogspot.com/">Adopt-A-Microbe version 2.0</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="grants.md">Education and Outreach Grants</a></strong>
Our education and outreach goals include creating distinctive, targeted education programs and promoting increased public awareness about life below the seafloor. C-DEBI is pleased to announce our Education and Outreach Grants (up to $50,000) are available to fund research or education/outreach projects on any area of marine deep biosphere topics. The program will fund the development of educational opportunities and materials that are pertinent to deep biosphere research in the subseafloor environment.</p>

Kids explore how scientists are discovering amazing creatures that may help us find life on other planets. Written in rhyming verse by Kevin Kurtz and illustrated by Alice Feagan, this iBook also includes interactive videos, photos and other media about the astonishing world of seafloor microbes. Also available as a PDF that can be viewed on any ~~computer~~ device or printed.\n\n**[Deep Biosphere Expedition and Sampling Videos](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/outputs-resources/videos/)**\nWatch the videos from our deep biosphere expeditions to learn what C-DEBI is doing and find out what’s so interesting, and why ~~is it~~ ++it's++ important!\n\n**[Research Backgrounders and Experts on the Marine Deep Biosphere](http://metcalfinstitute.org/c-debi/)**\nThe Metcalf Institute for Marine & Environmental Reporting has developed a series of Research Backgrounders and a C-DEBI Experts List ??? shoud/can the backgrounders and expert list be updated for phase 2? ??? to communicate exciting developments in our research of the marine deep biosphere to the journalism and science-writing communities as well as the general public. Supported through a C-DEBI Education and Outreach Grant, these scientifically-vetted resources including a dedicated insight into each of the C-DEBI research themes are intended to assist journalists in their efforts to understand and report on these complex but broadly significant findings.\n\n**[Networked Speaker Series](../community/nss.md)**\nC-DEBI is a “networked” Science and Technology Center, gathering expertise, ideas, and participation from institutions across the U.S. and around the world. C-DEBI runs the Networked Speaker Series as one means to enhance communication and the exchange of ideas via short (30 minute) presentations with time for questions and discussion. The series is presented live online for remote participants, and is recorded and available on the website for those unable to \"attend\" the live events.\n\n**[ROV (Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicle) Designs](https://csumb.edu/eel/c-debi-catalina-rov)**\n??? Probably time to check with Geoff for updates ??? Build your own ROV with these designs to be used as platforms for project-based K-8 marine education and outreach supported through a C-DEBI Education and Outreach Grant.\n\n**Science at Sea Outreach**\n??? There may be some value to mining the blogs that are still up for media and lesson plans, but perhaps we should favor our Twitter feed and any currently/recently-active sites in the community? Jen Biddle's speaker series website comes to mind. ??? Learn about our deep biosphere research directly from seagoing expeditions on the JOIDES Resolution and other expeditions associated with C-DEBI research.\n\n>Explore the hidden wonders of the deep continental slope of the northern Gulf of Mexico from offshore Mississippi to Texas: its bubbling mud volcanoes, quiet brine lakes, seafloor gas hydrates, oil seep sites, and also the seafloor near the Macondo wellhead at over 1500 meters depth, will be visited by deepsea submersible Alvin, its pilots and science observers. Follow the [cruise blog](http://teskelab2014.wordpress.com/) March 29 – April 23, 2014 to explore and document the deep Gulf of Mexico ecosystem, its lasting damage and beginning recovery almost four years after the Deepwater Horizon blowout.\n>\nWe returned to [North Pond](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/research-activities/major-field-sites/north-pond/) in 2011, a site located in the very middle of the Atlantic Ocean, to investigate the microbiology of this location which has been studied nearly continuously for its geological, geophysical, and hydrological characteristics since first drilled in 1975/1976.  See the blog from the [first expedition](http://northpondexpedition.usc.edu/) in 2009 and [Return to North Pond Expedition 336 blog](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/return-to-northpond/) linked to _Scientific American_. Link to the [Adopt-A-Microbe Project](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/adoptamicrobe/) and the [Classroom Connection](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/classroomconnection) initiative from the [Expedition 336 Hub](http://joidesresolution.org/node/1983).\n>\nScientists and educators on the Hydrogeology at [Juan de Fuca](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/research-activities/major-field-sites/juan-de-fuca/) Expedition (Summer 2011) explored how water flows in the earth's crust beneath the seafloor, and examined geochemistry, rock alteration and microbes living in the seafloor - all off the west coast of the United States. This expedition is a direct follow-on from IODP Expedition 327 (2010), when subseafloor observatories (CORKs) were placed in the seafloor on the Juan de Fuca ridge. The returning expedition to these installations used the Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) JASON to download data, retrieve samples, and make any necessary repairs to on-going experiments. See the Expedition Hubs ([2011](http://joidesresolution.org/node/1905) and [2010](http://joidesresolution.org/node/1154)) and the Adopt-A-Microbe activities ([2011](https://sites.google.com/site/adoptamicrobe3/) and [2010](https://sites.google.com/site/adoptamicrobe/)).\n>\nThe South Pacific Gyre Microbiology Expedition (2010) penetrated a total of 630 m at seven different drill sites to define the physical and chemical limits of subseafloor microbial life in tectonic and oceanographic settings not yet explored!  See the [Expedition Hub](http://joidesresolution.org/node/1412) and [Adopt-A-Microbe version 2.0](http://adoptamicrobe329.blogspot.com/).\n\n**[Education and Outreach Grants](grants.md)**\nOur education and outreach goals include creating distinctive, targeted education programs and promoting increased public awareness about life below the seafloor. C-DEBI is pleased to announce our Education and Outreach Grants (up to $50,000) are available to fund research or education/outreach projects on any area of marine deep biosphere topics. The program will fund the development of educational opportunities and materials that are pertinent to deep biosphere research in the subseafloor environment.\n\n::: also\nThis call is now closed.
