C-DEBI is a “networked” Science and Technology Center, gathering expertise, ideas, and participation from institutions across the U.S. and around the world. Our Networked Speaker Series is a means to enhance communication and the exchange of ideas among our community separated by thousands of miles via live online presentations with time for questions and discussion with remote participants. The series is also recorded and available on the website for those unable to "attend" the live events.

<dl><dt>The 2015-2016 NSS Speakers have been selected and will air on Thursdays this spring!</dt></dl>

## How To Connect To The Live Broadcast

This year's series will broadcast on Thursdays at 12:30PM PST/3:30PM EST.

To join the meeting:  
[http://usccollege.adobeconnect.com/cdebiremote/](http://usccollege.adobeconnect.com/cdebiremote/)

The Networked Speaker Series is broadcast as an Adobe Connect videoconference run through your internet browser (Firefox is recommended) via Adobe Flash player and thus may require a small add-in ([test your connection beforehand](http://usccollege.adobeconnect.com/common/help/en/support/meeting_test.htm)). The presentation will be recorded and available on the website for those unable to "attend" the live web event.

## Previous Speakers

As above, but not organized by season.

## Call for Nominations

<dl><dt>Nominations are now closed</dt></dl>

C-DEBI _**seeks nominations**_ for three speakers for the 2015-2016 program year. Potential speakers can be nominated by colleagues, mentors, or those mentored by C-DEBI participants; they may also self nominate. Selected _C-DEBI Networked Speakers_ will make a presentation online, using video conferencing tools, with assistance from the C-DEBI main office at USC. Presentations are to be about 30 minutes in length, with time allocated for questions and discussion. Networked viewers can participate in Q&A via their own web camera and speaker/microphone or by chat. We would like to have two presentations during the 2015-2016 academic year, ideally one in the winter and one in the spring. No travel will be required either to make a presentation or to listen/participate in a presentation. Presentations will be recorded for later online playback by participants or those who could not "attend" the live web event. Nominated _C-DEBI Networked Speakers_ should be capable of combining compelling visual materials with the ability to communicate effectively to a broad audience. _We are particularly enthusiastic about giving young researchers a chance to present work to the C-DEBI community_. Being selected to be a _C-DEBI Networked Speaker_ is an honor. Once speakers are selected, presentation dates and times for presentations will be determined and announced, along with instructions for connecting over the web.
