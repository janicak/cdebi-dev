## C-DEBI Annual Meetings

Members of the C-DEBI community meet annually to report on and discuss presently-active, C-DEBI-funded research and education and outreach projects. The size of the meeting is limited to approximately 70 people to support well-integrated discussions; priority invitation will be given to those C-DEBI participants with active grants who have not presented on their work previously.

Stay tuned for details regarding our next Annual Meeting. As in previous years, the meeting will be preceded by a graduate student and postdoctoral professional development workshop.

### C-DEBI Annual Meeting, October 5-6, 2015

_Sanctuary Beach Resort, Marina, California, USA_

The focus of this Annual Meeting was integration and collaboration.  At that time, we knew that we had been renewed and discussed future plans as well as reported on active C-DEBI research projects. The purpose of the meeting was to continue to give community members from different field sites and/or with different interests a significant opportunity to make new connections that will help us to collectively solve especially interesting problems in study of subsurface life. Consequently, a relatively large fraction of the meeting was set aside for (i) many very brief presentations and (ii) open-mic discussions.

This annual meeting was preceded by a C-DEBI/MARINE Graduate Student and Postdoctoral Professional Development Workshop on October 4, 2015 co-hosted by MARINE (Monterey Area Research Institutions' Network for Education). This day-long workshop "Making the Transition from Graduate Studies to the Interdisciplinary Workforce" aimed to better prepare the participants as future science leaders.

**Day 1**: Introduction and Renewal • Data Management and Integration • Education & Outreach • Omics Applications • Open Mic & Discussion • Dorado Outcrop • Open Mic & Discussion • Poster Session 1

**Day 2**: Metabolism and Model Organisms • Basement • Open Mic & Discussion • Sediments • Keynote • Open Mic & Discussion • Synthesis Discussion • Poster Session 2

## 2015 Sediment and Basement Workshops

In 2015, the C-DEBI theme workshops were replaced by biome (basement and sediment) workshops integrated across the research themes to review the state of knowledge at the end of Phase 1.

### C-DEBI Basement Workshop, 9-10 July 2015

_Harvard University, Cambridge, MA_

**Organizers:** Jason Sylvan (USC) & Julie Huber (MBL)

The initial invitation for the workshop summarized the desired outcomes: as the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations (C-DEBI) enters the final stage of Phase I, we are organizing a workshop to synthesize what we have learned about the microbial ecology of subseafloor basement environments, including igneous rocks and crustal fluids. Topics of discussion will include where the bleeding edge of subseafloor crustal microbiology lies, the biggest current obstacles to overcome, commonalities between sites and regimes that have come to light over the last five years (or more), and what questions will be most exciting to address in the coming decade. We are looking for input from microbial ecologists as well as geochemists and petrologists to help synthesize the current research and try to invigorate the community with interdisciplinary goals for the next phase of C-DEBI. Unlike previous C-DEBI workshops, this one will not focus on a specific theme, such as activity or diversity, but will rather look at the entirety of crustal microbiology. We hope you can join us in Boston this July for a few days of stimulating and productive discussions.

### C-DEBI Sediment Workshop, 25-26 June 2015

_University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA_

**Organizers:** Karen Lloyd (University of Tennessee, Knoxville) & Steven D'Hondt (URI)

The 2015 C-DEBI Sediment Workshop was held at the University of Southern California, June 25-26\. There were 16 in-person attendees and 2 people participating remotely. During the first part of the first day, each participant gave a short presentation on a research project or interest relevant to the subseafloor sedimentary biosphere. For the remainder of the first day and the second day, the participants engaged in group discussion of the following three questions about the deep subseafloor sedimentary biosphere: 1. What is known? 2. What are the major questions? 3. How can we go about answering these questions?

## 2010-2014 Research Theme Team Workshops

In the initial phase of C-DEBI, the following four themes were the focus of C-DEBI research, providing a conceptual framework for scientific investigation supported by C-DEBI across a broad scientific community: _Activity_, _Extent of Life_, _Limits to Life_, and _Evolution and Survival_. For each of these themes, Theme Team Leaders regularly brought together experts within and outside of C-DEBI to identify new research directions within each theme. Based on these “think tank” conversations, the Theme Team Leaders developed Requests for Proposals for the initial phase of C-DEBI small grants and fellowship programs.

### Research Theme I. Activity in the Deep Subseafloor Biosphere: function & rates of global biogeochemical processes

*Theme Team Leaders:* Wiebke Ziebis (USC, 2010) & Beth Orcutt (Bigelow, 2012-2014)

What is the global consequence of microbial activity in the marine deep sediment and crustal biospheres? How quickly, or slowly, do processes occur, and what factors regulate these rates? What types of microbial processes are dominant in different environments, and why? What are cell specific rates of activity in the marine deep biosphere? Through targeted support of research aiming to quantify geographic distributions of subseafloor sedimentary respiration, rates and magnitude of microbial crustal alteration, energy sources and carbon flow, C-DEBI enables robust analyses linking subseafloor processes to global scales and biogeochemical cycles.

### Research Theme II. Extent of Life: biomes and the degree of connectivity (biogeography and dispersal)

*Theme Team Leader:* Andreas Teske (UNC, 2010-2014)

Over time, the interplay of microbial dispersal and environmental selection creates a distinct biogeography of microbes in the subseafloor. What microbes take seed where and why? What are the most significant physical and chemical controls of these colonization processes? How similar or different are the resulting microbial ecosystems in the ocean crust and in deep sediment from each other and from the overlying deep ocean? By studying multiple sites and subseafloor habitats, C-DEBI research aims to develop a global model for biogeography of microbes below the seafloor.

### Research Theme III. Limits to Life: extremes and norms of carbon, energy, nutrient, temperature, pressure, pH

*Theme Team Leader:* Tom McCollom (UC Boulder, 2010-2014)

Numerous studies by C-DEBI participants and others continue to show that microbial life is widespread in the subseafloor. At the same time, however, life is not everywhere, and where it does occur it appears to operate at very slow metabolic rates. How do environmental variables such as temperature, pressure, nutrient availability, fluid flow, pore space, etc. limit the distribution and metabolism of microorganisms in the deep subsurface? What defines the boundary where life can no longer exist in the deep subsurface? C-DEBI promotes investigations into the factors that limit the extent and activity of life in the deep subseafloor, including field, laboratory, and theoretical studies.

### Research Theme IV. Evolution and Survival: adaptation, enrichment, and repair

*Theme Team Leaders:* Bill Nelson (USC, 2010-2013) & Julie Huber (2013-2014)

Reproduction, change, and selection are necessary elements of any evolutionary trajectory, but we know very little about evolution and adaptation in subseafloor habitats. What are the metabolic drivers that might lead to selection in the subseafloor? In an environment where biomass turnover may occur on a timescale of hundreds to thousands of years, can you actually detect evolutionary changes? How does lateral gene transfer impact evolutionary trajectories in the subseafloor? Through a combination of field and laboratory based measurements, C-DEBI research aims to examine these key questions about microbial evolutionary processes in the subseafloor.

## 2009-2014 DEBI RCN (Research Coordination Network) Meetings

With the DEBI RCN, we held annual, theme-based meetings to address the research and coordination efforts of the growing deep biosphere community. These meetings enabled scientists and students to exchange ideas in deep biosphere studies, to learn about practical developments and study opportunities in the field, and to coordinate research and education activities. Each meeting was part **scientific conference** and part **training workshop**, both parts focused on a specific theme within deep biosphere research. These key themes included microbiology in sediments and basement rock, organic geochemistry and biosignatures, bioenergetics, hydrogeology, and drilling and sampling technology.
