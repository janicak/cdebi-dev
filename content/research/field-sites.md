==Pre-emptively renamed from "Major Field Sites" to "Field Sites"==

When C-DEBI was first proposed as a NSF-sponsored Science and Technology Center (STC), three field site based programs formed the core of C-DEBI scientific and technical activities: Juan de Fuca Ridge Flank, North Pond, and South Pacific Gyre. Each of these "Major Programs" has completed primary drilling and associated operations, although site visits, observatory servicing, laboratory analyses, and modeling related to these sites will continue for some years. The major field sites designated in Phase 1 of C-DEBI feature characteristics along a continuum of field habitats based on hydrothermal vigor, basement age, and thermal state.

==Some mention of non-major sites warranted?==
These major field sites are poised to make significant contributions towards achieving fundamental C-DEBI objectives. These programs are funded and/or scheduled for operations, mainly with support external to the Center. These programs use C-DEBI resources to leverage other funding and opportunities.

## Eastern Flank of the Juan de Fuca (JdF) Ridge

**Led by:** [Andrew Fisher](https://campusdirectory.ucsc.edu/detail.php?type=people&uid=afisher), University of California Santa Cruz

[Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 327](http://iodp.tamu.edu/scienceops/expeditions/juan_de_fuca.html) (July 5 - September 4, 2010) and subsequent UNOLS follow-up cruises are parts in a series of long-term multidisciplinary experiments that build from technical and scientific achievements and lessons learned during [Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 168](http://www-odp.tamu.edu/publications/168_SR/main.htm) and [IODP Expedition 301](http://iodp.tamu.edu/scienceops/expeditions/exp301.html), on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge.

### Background

==The text here, as with the other programs, was lifted directly from the Annual Report. Should the writing be pitched differently for the website - and shorter if we're going to be including additional field sites?==

==In the overview paragraph, "Major Programs" was in quotes - are we still referring to major programs?== The Juan de Fuca Ridge flank ++major program++ is exploring the nature of linked hydrogeologic, geochemical, and microbiological conditions and processes in a region that is the best understood example of ridge-flank hydrothermal circulation on the planet. In this setting, a volcanic crustal aquifer contains highly altered (suboxic to anoxic), warm (64 °C) hydrothermal fluids that are isolated from the overlying ocean in most locations by hundreds of meters of hemipelagic sediment and turbidites. Projects using data and field samples from this region have included two IODP expeditions (301 and 327); long-term borehole observatories (CORKs) used for testing, monitoring and sampling; and numerous non-drilling oceanographic expeditions using oceanographic ships and submersibles/ROVs, laboratory studies using materials and associated microbial cultures, and theoretical and computational experiments. Tools and methods developed for the JdF program have been adapted and applied at other sites, including other C-DEBI major program locations.

The JdF major program has contributed to training of numerous graduate and undergraduate students and other junior researchers, including those who add diversity to the STEM pipeline; has linked researchers and students from across the US and around the world, who work on common technical and scientific goals; and has comprised the basis for several successful education and outreach programs to the K-12 community and the public at large.

More specifically, the JdF major program has explored these and related questions:

*   What are the rates, directions, and distributions of fluid and coupled energy, solute, and microbial processes within the volcanic crustal aquifer?
*   How do microbial populations in the volcanic crust differ from location to location, and from those found in the overlying ocean and sediments?
*   How do microbial processes contribute to rock and fluid alteration?

Answering these and related questions will help to achieve goals important to Phase 2 of C-DEBI, within all three of the new program themes (Connectivity and Fluxes, Activities and Communities, Metabolism and Survival).

==These last two paragraphs feel like they should come before the bulleted questions and Phase 2 summary.==

The JdF major program emphasizes a ridge-flank hydrothermal system that represents an important end-member in terms of crustal temperature, redox state, and through-put of fluids (and associated solutes, inoculum, etc). Results from this area are especially important in comparison to results derived from the NP and DO major programs. The latter is a system operating at much cooler and more oxic conditions, which may be characteristic of a large fraction of young and well-ventilated volcanic crust, whereas JdF is more typical in many ways of older sites where there is much more limited exposure of permeable basement rocks to the overlying ocean.

The JdF major program is also distinct for being the first at which controlled, cross-hole experiments have been completed, including the first tracer-injection experiment in the ocean crust. In addition, the JdF studies have produced the longest time-series records of subseafloor conditions, including high-quality and large-volume subseafloor samples collected from multiple boreholes and depths.


==As with the other sections, I replaced recent accomplishments, which feels like more of a report than a web page, and for the sake of brevity, with a link to the most recent annual report. Should these links be to all annual reports, and/or should the reports be split into smaller PDFs?==

## North Pond (NP) - Mid-Atlantic Ridge Microbiology

**Led by:** [Geoff Wheat](http://www.sfos.uaf.edu/directory/faculty/wheat/), University of Alaska, Fairbanks

### Background

About one-third of the seafloor is underlain by oceanic crust that was formed at slow spreading ridges, resulting in seafloor morphology with many ridges and valleys (“mountain ranges”) that are roughly parallel to the spreading center. With age, the valleys fill with sediment, but exposed basalt is commonplace, allowing seawater to ventilate and cool the crust.

The North Pond project was envisioned to investigate the origin, nature, and activity of microbial communities within basaltic basement below an isolated sediment "pond." NP, which is located on the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 22°45'N and 46°05'W and overlies 8Ma-old crust, was chosen in part because the site has been explored for decades. These exploratory studies have provided a geologic and hydrologic context for microbial studies.

Most recently, subseafloor observatories (CORKs) were installed at NP during [IODP Expedition 336](http://iodp.tamu.edu/scienceops/expeditions/midatlantic_ridge_microbio.html) (Sept. - Nov. 2011) to collect and monitor active, low temperature, oxygenated fluids that advect vigorously through basaltic basement and to take the first step in conducting manipulative experiments within this natural setting.

The three guiding questions for research at NP are:

*   What is the nature of microbial communities harbored in young ridge flanks and what is their role in ocean crust alteration?
*   Are these communities unique, particularly in comparison with seafloor and sedimentary communities?
*   Where do deep-seated microbial communities come from (sediment, rock, seawater, other)?

To address these questions, and many more detailed ones, a team of international researchers undertook a site survey expedition prior to IODP Expedition 336, during which material was recovered (sediment and crustal rocks) and three borehole observatories were installed (CORKs). Five months later (April 2012) an ROV expedition deployed another observatory (CORK-Lite), collected fluids from the CORKs, deployed experiments, and recovered pressure data. A second ROV expedition in April 2014 collected more CORK fluids, recovered seafloor experiments, and deployed some additional ones. Much of the cost for this fieldwork was supported by our German colleagues, the IODP, and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.

Results completed this year from samples and data recovered during these four expeditions continue to shed light on all four Phase 1 C-DEBI themes. In addition, ongoing and planned research fit within the context of the three Phase 2 themes.

## South Pacific Gyre (SPG)

**Led by:** [Steven D’Hondt](http://www.gso.uri.edu/users/dhondt), University of Rhode Island

### Background

The focus at this study site is on life beneath the seafloor in the most oligotrophic region of the world ocean - the South Pacific Gyre. [Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 329](http://iodp.tamu.edu/scienceops/expeditions/south_pacific_gyre_microbio.html), led by Co-Chief Scientists Steven D’Hondt and Fumio Inagaki, cored and logged deep-sea sediment and basaltic basement at seven SPG sites in 2010\. Our present activity in this program focuses on post-expedition studies of samples and data from Expedition 329\. The primary purposes of this project are to:

*   Document the nature of microbial communities and test the energetic limit to life in the most food-poor deep-sea sediment
*   Test the influence of basement age and sediment thickness on basement habitability, microbial communities, and the hydrologic evolution of crustal basalt.

This project addresses fundamental questions about subseafloor life, including the following:

*   Is there a lower limit to life in oligotrophic subseafloor sediment?
*   Are the communities in mid-gyre subseafloor sediments uniquely structured (how do these communities compare to those previously studied nearer to the continents)?
*   Is the primary electron donor organic matter from the surface world or hydrogen from _in situ_ radioactive splitting of water?
*   Do microbial activities and composition vary with properties of the surface world, such as sea surface chlorophyll concentrations or organic flux to the seafloor?
*   Is microbial activity sustainable in subseafloor basalt by mineral oxidation (_e.g.,_ oxidation of iron in the basaltic minerals) or other processes for tens of Myrs after basalt formation?

Answering these questions will help to achieve all three of the broader C-DEBI themes/objectives.

## Dorado Outcrop (DO)

**Led by:** [Geoff Wheat](http://www.sfos.uaf.edu/directory/faculty/wheat/), University of Alaska, Fairbanks

### Background

The Dorado Outcrop program builds on decades of research that observed differences between measured and theoretical heat flow values in the ocean crust. Lister (1972) postulated that these differences resulted from the cooling of the crust by the circulation of seawater. The magnitude of this circulation is large, redistributing 10 TW (one fourth) of the Earth’s heat loss. Then, in 1977, the first seafloor hydrothermal system was discovered; however, such systems, driven by the intrusion of magma, account for 20% of the total convective heat loss from oceanic crust. The remaining heat loss is transported on the ridge flanks at much cooler temperatures, yet with a net fluid flux that is commensurate with that of rivers. Given this magnitude of fluid flow, it has been postulated that even a minimal (1-5%) loss or gain from seawater-crustal exchange could impact global geochemical budgets in the ocean; however, until recently such a representative system had yet to be sampled.

Off the west coast of Costa Rica on 23 Ma-old crust lies the Dorado Outcrop, a small (0.5 km wide by 2 km long and 150 m high) basaltic outcrop that that trends southeast-northwest and is characteristic of typical ridge flank hydrothermal systems. In 2013 we surveyed DO using the autonomous underwater vehicle Sentry and the remotely operated vehicle Jason II (AT26-09) ([cruise report](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/DoradoCruiseReport2013.pdf)). Surveys generated a bathymetric map from which visual and thermal surveys located sites where crustal fluids vented and placed them within a geologic context. The outcrop consists of basaltic pillows and sheet flows with linear faults that are tens to hundreds of meters long and in the general trend of the outcrop. Surprisingly hydrothermal fluids do not currently vent from these linear features.

Instead, diffuse hydrothermal activity was identified from thermal anomalies determined from temperature probes mounted on the ROV and AUV. Such anomalies guided closer inspection with a manipulator-held device. Over one hundred thermal measurements were made with the warmest recorded temperature of 12.3°C, well above the bottom water temperature (1.85°C). Most of the hydrothermal flow occurred ubiquitously along the southwestern portion of the outcrop with the most vigorous site that spans hundreds of square meters (Marker K). In 2013, spring samples were collected and continuous fluid samplers (OsmoSamplers), and temperature loggers were deployed. Because of the diffuse nature of the springs, we developed a novel syringe-based fluid sampler that we used in 2014 with the submersible Alvin during which we recovered samplers and sensors, collected additional fluids, and measured dissolved oxygen in situ ([cruise report](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/Dorado%20Outcrop%202014%20Cruise%20Report%20reduced.pdf)).
