C-DEBI is currently taking stock of past, current, and future bioinformatic needs for the deep subseafloor biosphere community, including centralizing sequencing analysis tools, archiving data, and helping C-DEBI grantees with their bioinformatic needs. Requests for bioinformatic support should be made directly (in triplicate via e-mail) to [Benjamin Tully](mailto:tully.bj@gmail.com) (USC), [John Heidelberg](mailto:jheidelb@usc.edu) (USC), and [Julie Huber](mailto:jhuber@mbl.edu) (MBL) and include a brief scope of work and current status of the project. Together with the C-DEBI Executive Committee, projects will be prioritized and scope of support determined.
