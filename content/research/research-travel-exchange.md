## Call for Proposals

C-DEBI facilitates scientific coordination and collaborations by supporting student, postdoctoral, and faculty exchanges to build, educate and train the deep subseafloor biosphere community. We award small research and travel grants for Center affiliates. These grants may be used to support research, travel for presenting C-DEBI research at meetings, or travel exchanges to other partner institutions or institutions that have new tools and techniques that can be applied to C-DEBI research.

Research exchanges establish direct linkages among groups within individual institutions, which are intended to result in a well-connected community and the development of future deep subseafloor biosphere researchers and leaders. These exchanges allow a C-DEBI researcher (student/postdoctoral/faculty) to spend 1-6 months at a participating C-DEBI community host laboratory to carry out experiments, use analytical equipment, learn a new tool, and/or join a research cruise. Research exchanges may operate between any willing C-DEBI collaborating laboratories. Travel exchanges function similarly.

Financial support for exchanges through C-DEBI will be ~50% of the total cost. Matching funds would be required, for example, a travel award from any program that supports student awards in this way (e.g., Geological Society of America, NASA Lewis and Clark fellowships), or by other means, such as matching support from the researcher's institution or from a postdoctoral supervisor. We anticipate ~10 awards of $500-5000 to be granted annually. Research exchange proposals are to support travel to a lab to start a collaboration and can support up to $500 in research costs, up to $3500 for domestic travel and up to $4500 for international travel, such that with the match, the total budget is limited to $8000 for a domestic exchange or $10,000 for an international exchange.

>**This is a rolling call.**

>**C-DEBI encourages women and underrepresented groups to apply.** This funding is only available to individuals sponsored in US institutions.

## Application & Submission

A complete application consists of the following:

1.  Cover page ([PDF form](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/C-DEBIexchange_coverpage.pdf))
2.  Research or travel proposal (2 pages) outlining the intended objective and anticipated outcome of a research or travel exchange
3.  Budget (1 page) outlining expected costs of the exchange as well as other sources of funds which will be used to support the exchange
4.  Confirmation of financial commitment for matching funds
5.  CV
6.  Two letters of support. **For students and postdoctorals,** one letter must be from your advisor and include a statement acknowledging the absence from the home institution.
7.  Letter of support from the advisor at the hosting institution (if applicable)

Recipients of the exchange awards will be required to present their findings at the subsequent [annual C-DEBI meeting](../community/meetings-workshops.md). In addition, they will prepare a short summary of their exchange experience for display on the C-DEBI website. Acknowledgement of NSF and C-DEBI support is mandatory in all associated oral and poster presentations and publications.

Please submit your proposal (preferably as a single PDF in the above order) to Rosalynn Sylvan, C-DEBI ManagingÂ Director ([rosalyyl@usc.edu](mailto:rosalyyl@usc.edu))
