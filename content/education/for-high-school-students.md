**[Summer Marine Science Camp](http://dornsife.usc.edu/uscseagrant/summer-science-programs/)**  
: In partnership with USC Sea Grant, C-DEBI offers a weeklong Summer Science Camp providing high school students from underrepresented backgrounds the opportunity to visit the USC Wrigley Marine Science Center on Catalina Island, and other coastal sites and explore marine science with hands-on learning. Students get amazing opportunities to work with local researchers, conduct their own research projects, learn about careers in marine science, and explore the marine protected areas around the island. A highlight of this camp is exploration through technology as students build a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) and learn about deep-sea research done by the Centerâ€™s researchers.

**[Young Researchers Program](http://youngresearchers.usc.edu/)**  
: The USC Young Researchers Program is a six-week program co-sponsored by C-DEBI that matches talented and motivated Los Angeles-area high school rising seniors with USC research groups for a summer of research under the supervision of faculty and graduate students. Students get to experience first-hand the excitement of research in real university labs. The research work is supplemented with weekly workshops to give students some basic tools to help them get into college and pursue degrees in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields.
