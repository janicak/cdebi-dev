Our highest priority goal is to create ~~distinctive, targeted~~ education programs at the K-12, undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels in order to train and foster the next generation of ???Vaguely recalling that the focus was shifted to STEM more generally???++deep subseafloor biosphere researchers++. This is first and foremost to ensure the robust, continued development of this new field ~~, and to arm the field~~ with the brightest ~~and~~++,++ most creative young minds ~~that can take what has been built over the past decade and greatly expand it in this decade via C-DEBI~~ ++to build and expand on the Center's achievements++.

We are creating ~~broad based~~ educational opportunities that allow the Center’s newly generated knowledge to ~~thrive~~ ++spread++~~,~~ and ~~we are designing special programs to provide opportunities for all segments of our society. We~~ are committed to ~~making sure~~ ++ensuring++ that ~~future scientists are~~ ++the next generation of deep subseafloor biosphere researchers is++ representative of the full diversity of our society. ~~These students will become the next generation of deep subseafloor biosphere researchers who fully integrate the Center’s tools and technology into their science.~~

~~Additionally, we must translate~~ ++We are promoting++ ~~knowledge in and of~~ our field++'s discoveries++ to the broader public~~, in part through our core education program (which will flow to public policy, administration, and other education fields in addition to academic fields) — but also~~ via programs that promote ~~broader~~ dissemination of information and increased awareness ~~to the public~~ about the tremendous fraction of life on Earth that appears to be buried below the seafloor in sediment and rocks. ++Additionally, our core training programs include components extending to public policy, administration and educational fields.++
