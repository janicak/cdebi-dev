## Professional Development

==Include mention of prof. development workshop before Annual Meeting? Ben's bioinformatics workshops?==

**Graduate Student & Postdoctoral Mailing List**  
: Our mailing list is a forum for C-DEBI and non-C-DEBI graduate students and postdocs to discuss topics pertaining to their research, professional development, and employment/fellowship opportunities.

  ::: callout
  Join the gang of hundreds by sending your request to C-DEBI Education Director Stephanie Schroeder ([slschroe@usc.edu](mailto:slschroe@usc.edu)).

**Professional Development Webinars**  
: The graduate student and postdoctoral webinar series is part of C-DEBI’s professional development program.  Only graduate students and postdocs participate in the live interactive webinars, which afterwards are archived and available to the entire C-DEBI community.  See the inaugural science communication [“Elevator Talk” webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4XdEx4_UeU) presented by Dr. Myrna Jacobson-Meyers (USC), David Bader, Emily Yam, and Jenny Lentz (Aquarium of the Pacific). ==Others?==

**[Networked Speaker Series](../community/nss.md)**  
: C-DEBI is a “networked” Science and Technology Center, gathering expertise, ideas, and participation from institutions across the U.S. and around the world. C-DEBI runs the Networked Speaker Series as one means to enhance communication and the exchange of ideas via short (30 minute) presentations with time for questions and discussion. The series is presented live online for remote participants, and is recorded and available on the website for those unable to "attend" the live events.

**[SoCal Geobiology Symposium](http://geobio2016.gps.caltech.edu/)**  
: The Southern California Geobiology Symposium is an annual student-run event designed to bring geobiologists together to discuss current research and build local collaborations. It is an opportunity for undergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs to present geobiological research in the form of oral and poster presentations. The topics presented span various disciplines including geology, geochemistry, astrobiology, microbiology, oceanography, paleobiology/-ecology and environmental sciences.  With sponsorship by C-DEBI, the symposium is hosted in rotation by USC, Caltech and UC Riverside.

## Fellowships and Grants

**[Graduate Student and Postdoctoral Fellowships](../research/research-fellowships.md)**  
: C-DEBI provides support for graduate student and postdoctoral fellowships awarded on the basis of scientific excellence and the appropriateness of the subject matter to Center objectives. The goal of the fellowship program is to stimulate the advancement of deep biosphere research through the training of a new generation of innovative scientists. Potential fellows should contact and discuss research topics for fellowships with potential advisors, as successful candidates will be expected to have well-conceived research plans as well as willing advisors.

**[Travel Exchange Grants](../research/research-travel-exchange.md)**  
: C-DEBI facilitates scientific coordination and collaborations by supporting student, postdoctoral, and faculty exchanges to build, educate and train the deep subseafloor biosphere community. These small matching grants of $500-5000 may be used to support research, travel for presenting C-DEBI research at meetings, or travel exchanges to other partner institutions or institutions that have new tools and techniques that can be applied to C-DEBI research.

**Research Grants and Education & Outreach Grants**  
: For postdoctorals able to act as principal investigators at their institutions, submit proposals for our [Research Grants](../research/research-grants.md) and [Education and Outreach Grants](grants.md). C-DEBI invites research proposals in support of marine deep biosphere research concerning life in marine sediments and volcanic ocean crust. C-DEBI invites proposals in support of our education and outreach goals which include creating distinctive, targeted education programs and promoting increased public awareness about life below the seafloor.

## Courses

**[International GeoBiology Course](http://dornsife.usc.edu/wrigley/geobiology/)**  
: The “GeoBio” Course is an intense, multidisciplinary summer course exploring the coevolution of the Earth and its biosphere, with an emphasis on how microbial processes affect the environment and leave imprints on the rock record. Participants get hands-on experience in cutting-edge geobiological techniques including molecular biology, bioinformatics, geochemistry, petrology and sedimentology, and work in research groups to solve relevant questions.  The GeoBiology Course is open to students and researchers at any level, although we give preference to graduate students in their early to mid years of study.
