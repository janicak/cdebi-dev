## Course Description

Spend your summer doing exciting, cutting-edge research—no experience needed! Be part of a research center that studies life below the oceans, in the sediments and rocks of the subseafloor. This ecosystem is largely unexplored, and we need students to help grow, isolate, describe, and ultimately name the microorganisms referred to as ‘intraterrestrials.’ C4 students will work in teams in laboratories at USC, learning state-of-the-art techniques ranging from DNA sequencing to microscopy and sterile techniques to analytical chemistry.

C4 students will be part of a greater research community, the Center for Dark Energy Biopshere Investigations (C-DEBI). C-DEBI seeks to better understand the ecology of the subseafloor as the global ocean comprises the Earth’s largest biome, with microorganisms playing a dominant biogeochemical role.

**What:** Paid stipend, 9-week, residential, research internship at USC. Conduct research 40 hours/week in a microbiology/geochemistry lab  

**Where:** University of Southern California  

**When:** June 12 - August 13, 2016  

**Who:** Undergraduates from community colleges*

**Stipend:** $500/week, plus lodging & travel

\*First generation college, women, and under-represented students encouraged to apply
