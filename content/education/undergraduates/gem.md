## Course Description

The GEM Course is a four-week program integrating classroom learning with field sampling and laboratory protocols in microbial ecology to engage students in scientific analysis and learning. Learn what bacteria are, how they work, and what they do at the University of Southern California, the Eastern Sierra Mountains and the Wrigley Marine Science Center on Catalina Island. Our ideal candidate is early in their college career, scientifically curious, and a hard-working learner.

Microbes are the beginning and end for almost every process on earth! From hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean, to tropical rainforests near the equator, and from the North to South Pole, microbiologists uncover their secrets.

Funded by the National Science Foundation, C-DEBI offers the Global Environmental Microbiology (GEM) course in microbiology and microbial ecology. Taught by Drs. [John Heidelberg](http://dornsife.usc.edu/cf/faculty-and-staff/faculty.cfm?pid=1012506&CFID=19613235&CFTOKEN=12071377) and [Eric Webb](http://dornsife.usc.edu/cf/faculty-and-staff/faculty.cfm?pid=1012510), this field-based, hands-on course is:

*   Offered at the University of Southern California
*   Four weeks in length in the Summer of 2016
*   Week 1 at USC with lectures and labs
*   Week 2 in the Eastern Sierra Mountains
*   Weeks 3 and 4 at Wrigley Marine Science Center on Santa Catalina Island

So come and get your "feet wet" in microbial ecology and learn what bacteria are, how they work, and what they do. Explore DNA, genetics and genomics and their potential function in the environment. Figure out how microbes are used - not just for wine and cheese. Course expenses, travel, room and board are paid for by C-DEBI.

### Course Schedule

**Week 1: Introduction to Microbiology**

 :  In the first week of the course, lectures will focus on beginning our tour of the microbial world and discussing what microbiology is all about.  We will cover the importance of microbes, the cell as the fundamental unit of life and how microbes shape the world around us.  Further, we will discuss the historic roots of microbiology and explain how scientists hundreds of years ago came to realize that these very small organisms existed.

    **Hands-on laboratories:**

    *   Pipetting techniques
    *   Introduction to basic molecular lab techniques
    *   Student presentation preparation and delivery

**Week 2: Aquatic and Terrestrial Microbiology**

:  In this week, we leave the USC campus and head to the Eastern Sierra Nevada Mountains to focus our attention on unique terrestrial and aquatic environments, the bacteria that live there, and how they make their living.  While many people think of bacteria solely as 'germs' that are bent on infecting humans or other animals, more commonly bacteria play an important role in global biogeochemical cycles as both consumers and producers.

    **Hands-on laboratories:**

    *   Field measurements and sampling
    *   Bright field, phase, and epifluorescent microscopy

**Week 3: Marine Microbiology and Oceanography**

: This week students leave the mountains and cruise to Santa Catalina Island and the USC Wrigley Marine Science Center, a state-of-the-art teaching facility and research laboratory.  Here students will experience more in-depth learning of microbial habitats/processes with corresponding intensive lab work to introduce students to a systems view understanding of microbiology.

    **Hands-on laboratories:**

    *   Seawater sampling
    *   Water quality analyses
    *   DNA amplification (PCR)
    *   Molecular analysis of microbial communities

**Week 4: Microbial Habitats and Course Synthesis**

: The final week of the course focuses on the subsurface microbial biosphere of the ocean through an introduction to Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) and seafloor sampling.  Students also progress and intensify their study of microbial metabolisms and are introduced to basic bioinformatics.  The course culminates with lectures to tie together course learning and experiences as well as student presentations.

    **Hands-on laboratories:**

    *   Basic bioinformatics
    *   ROV exploration
