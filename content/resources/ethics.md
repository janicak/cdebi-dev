## Conflict of Interest (CoI) Definitions and Policies

**Definition of Conflict of Interest:**

: The C-DEBI ExCom and Ethics Committee define a Conflict of Interest as occurring when "an individual has multiple financial, personal or professional interests or is involved in multiple activities, one of which could compromise, or have the appearance of compromising, the motivation for an act in another."

This definition is based on _perception_ or _potential_ for conflict, requiring that the STC operate with policies ~~that prevent a CoI, avoiding~~ ++preventing Conflicts of Interest to avoid++ the need for later redress or a loss of trust from the community at large.

### Implications for Review of Small Grant Proposals

Proposal review panel members may not review a proposal for which they have a CoI. In the context of proposal review, a CoI would include (but may not be limited to): being employed by the same institution, having a history of student/postdoctoral-advisor relationship, having had a personal (romantic or familial) relationship, being a recent (in the past five years) co-author on a publication or a co-PI on a recent proposal. In addition, members of a review panel who have a CoI with a proposal under review may not be part of conversations in which that proposal is evaluated or discussed. If proposals are to be ranked, a panel member with a CoI will not be permitted to rank a conflicted proposal.

### Ethical Misconduct Resolution

Members of the C-DEBI community (both USC- and non-USC-based ~~members~~) have two avenues for resolving a situation of potential ethical misconduct. The first avenue is to openly raise a complaint to the Ethics Panel. The second avenue allows the person raising the issue to remain anonymous to the C-DEBI community by calling the USC ethics hotline ([http://ooc.usc.edu/help-hotline](http://ooc.usc.edu/help-hotline)) and describing the problem. The USC Office of Compliance will then contact the C-DEBI Ethics Panel without identifying the person who supplied the information. The ~~Ethics~~ Panel will then work with the C-DEBI Executive Committee to resolve the situation. Any further contact with the ~~original contact person~~ ++complainant++ will use the Office of Compliance as an intermediary.

### Example Scenario

A student notices that her PhD advisor has knowingly placed figures and data produced by one of her advisor's previous postdocs into a new publication. There is no attribution in the authorship, acknowledgments, or citations for the postdoc’s work. The postdoc's research had been funded by a C-DEBI fellowship. The student would like to take action against this ethical misconduct. However, she does not want to be identified to anyone else in the C-DEBI community, or to her advisor. So, the student looks on the C-DEBI website and finds the number for the USC hotline. She calls it, explains her evidence to them, and then they contact the C-DEBI Ethics Panel naming the advisor, but giving no information about the person who supplied the information. The C-DEBI Ethics Panel discusses the complaint, and deems it worthy of further discussion with the Executive Committee. Together, the two committees agree that further clarification on the ethical complaint is necessary, so they contact the USC Office of Compliance to get further information from the student.
